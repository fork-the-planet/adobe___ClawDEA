# ClawDEA

> **[Download latest release](https://github.com/adobe/ClawDEA/releases/latest)** · **[User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)**

Native [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) integration for IntelliJ IDEA — uses IDE's code indices, runs diagnostics, proposes edits, and drives the debugger, all without leaving the IDE.
Optionally builds a knowledge base to enhance LLM understanding of current and related projects.

### Install from release

1. Download `ClawDEA-<version>.zip` from the link above.
2. In IntelliJ: **Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…**
3. Select the zip and restart.

## Features

**Chat panel** — Streams Claude responses with Markdown, code blocks, tool-use cards, and clickable code references that navigate to source. Open from **Tools → Toggle ClawDEA Chat** (assign your own shortcut in Keymap settings).

**MCP server** — A local server exposes IntelliJ's indices as MCP tools: find files, usages, callers, implementations, supertypes, resolve symbols, read diagnostics, literal/regex content search via `search_text`, profiling (8 tools), and cross-project navigation via `list_workspace_repos` / `read_sibling_wiki` / `read_sibling_repo_state` when a workspace manifest is present — faster and more accurate than filesystem grep.

**Knowledge layer** — Project-local wiki under `.claude/wiki/` (auto-generated `REPO_STATE.md`, concept pages, primer). The primer ships with every turn so Claude starts each conversation already oriented. A bundled `wiki-librarian` subagent fields project-design questions in its own fresh context, citing concept pages and verifying claims against current source. A bundled `wiki-author` subagent drafts page edits when the commit-driven drift detector finds stale claims; with **Auto-update wiki on drift** enabled it lands edits unattended in the background. `/seed-workspace` assembles a multi-repo manifest for cross-repo navigation via `read_sibling_wiki` / `read_sibling_repo_state`.
Check out ClawDEA's own self-maintained wiki at https://github.com/adobe/ClawDEA/blob/main/.claude/wiki/index.md

**Debugger integration** — 21 MCP tools let Claude drive IntelliJ's debugger: launch sessions, set breakpoints (with conditions and log expressions), step through code, inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and modify values at runtime. Breakpoint ownership tracking ensures your breakpoints are never deleted.

**Profiling** — Claude can profile your code via JDK Flight Recorder: launch tests or run configurations with JFR instrumentation, then analyze CPU hotspots, allocation pressure, and memory leaks. Three entry points: `/profile` slash command, gutter icon on `@Test` methods, or imported `.jfr`/`.hprof` files. Claude reads the analysis results and proposes source-level fixes.

**Edit review** — When "Auto-accept Edits" is off, each proposed change opens a native IntelliJ diff dialog with Accept/Reject. Built-in Edit/Write calls that slip through are caught by a fallback layer with inline buttons and file revert.

**Tool permissions** — Three approval modes (Confirm all / Allow safe / Allow all). When the CLI requests permission for a tool call, ClawDEA honors Claude Code `permissions.allow` / `permissions.deny` rules first; otherwise an inline permission card appears in the chat tab that triggered the tool call (multi-panel routing) with Allow / Always allow / Deny buttons. The CLI blocks until you decide.

**@ mentions** — Type `@` for inline autocomplete (open editor tabs + recently git-modified files); press `@` then Tab to open a full picker with grouped Files and Symbols sections, backed by IntelliJ's filename and short-name caches.

**Inline completions** — Tab-completions powered by the Claude API, using editor context gathered by the context engine.

**Intention actions** (Alt+Enter) — Explain, Optimize, Generate Test, Security Check, Add Documentation, Refactor, Ask Claude, Fix with Claude.

**Slash commands** — `/stop`, `/clear`, `/mode`, `/cost`, `/compact`, `/context`, `/resume`, `/skills`, `/login`, `/cc`, `/init`, `/profile`, `/callers`, `/usages`, `/implementations`, `/supertypes`, `/refresh-view`, knowledge-layer commands (`/note`, `/promote-to-wiki`, `/learn`, `/seed-wiki`, `/refresh-wiki`, `/wiki-audit`, `/wiki-gap`, `/seed-workspace`), plus Claude Code skills discovered at runtime.

**Session resume** — Pick up a previous Claude Code session with conversation history replayed in the chat panel.

## Requirements

- IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1+
- Java 21
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Anthropic API key, Claude subscription, or AWS Bedrock / Google Vertex credentials

## Quick Start

1. Install the CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. Install the plugin from a release zip (or build from source — see below).
3. Open **Settings → Tools → ClawDEA** and configure your API key or sign in with a Claude subscription.
4. Press **Cmd+\\** to open the chat panel and start coding.

See the **[User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** for detailed configuration, slash commands, debugger workflows, and troubleshooting.

## Development

```
./gradlew runIde                           # Launch sandboxed IDE with the plugin
./gradlew test                             # Unit tests
./gradlew build -x buildSearchableOptions  # Full build (skip searchable options if IDE is running)
```

## Staying in sync with Claude Code

ClawDEA wraps the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess. To catch upstream changes (new flags, renamed stream-json fields, MCP config schema additions) without manual scanning, the repo runs a two-part monitoring system:

- A **weekly drift digest** (`.github/workflows/claude-code-drift.yml`) diffs `claude --help`, sub-command help, npm version, and selected docs URLs against a moving git tag (`drift-snapshot`); files an issue when a watchlisted regex matches a changed line.
- A **PR-time fixture replay test** (`CliFixtureReplayTest`) replays a recorded NDJSON transcript through `CliEventParser`; goes red if a new event type appears upstream.

See [`docs/drift-monitoring.md`](docs/drift-monitoring.md) for the full operator guide — adding watchlist entries, triaging auto-filed issues, refreshing the fixture, reseeding the snapshot tag.
