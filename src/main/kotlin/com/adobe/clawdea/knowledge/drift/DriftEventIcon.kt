/**
 * Per-kind icon and short label mappings for [DriftEvent]s, used by every
 * drift-surfacing UI (chat banner, auto-apply notifications, the
 * wiki-author digest, and the legacy `/refresh-wiki` prompt) so that all
 * surfaces share a consistent visual vocabulary.
 *
 * The `when` branches are exhaustive over the sealed [DriftEvent] hierarchy
 * deliberately — no `else`. Adding a new subtype must force a compile error
 * here so we never silently render an unlabeled event.
