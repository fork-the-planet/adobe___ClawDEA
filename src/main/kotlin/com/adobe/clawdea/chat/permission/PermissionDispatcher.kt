/**
 * Coordinates in-flight permission prompts.
 *
 * [submit] is called from the MCP handler thread; it creates a [PermissionRequest],
 * invokes [onRender] synchronously so the UI can emit a card, then waits on the
 * request's latch up to [DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT_MS] for the UI to call [resolve].
 *
 * The timeout is a workaround for a Claude Code regression (issue
 * anthropics/claude-code#50289, still open as of 2026-05): since CC v2.1.113 the
 * native binary ignores the per-server `timeout` field on HTTP MCP servers and
 * hard-stops every tool call at ~60s. If we keep the HTTP request open longer
 * than that, the CLI synthesises a tool failure on its side and the model
 * helpfully "tries something else" — exactly what the user does NOT want for a
 * pending permission prompt. We respond before the cliff (default 45s), and if
 * the user resolves later we cache the decision so the next retry of the same
 * (toolName, inputJson) skips the prompt entirely.
 *
 * Auto-allow notifications (e.g. "Allow all" silent-allow) flow through
 * [com.adobe.clawdea.chat.permission.AutoAllowSignal] instead — they are
 * panel-routed via the matching `ToolUse` event so multi-tab projects don't
 * render the marker in the wrong tab.
