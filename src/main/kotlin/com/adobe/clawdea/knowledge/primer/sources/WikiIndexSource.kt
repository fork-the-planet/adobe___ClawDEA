                |## How to use this wiki
                |
                |**Hard rule: your FIRST code-search tool call after reading the user message
                |must be a wiki probe.** Not `Read`, not `search_text`, not `find_files`, not
                |`Bash`. Exactly one `search_wiki` (1–3 keywords from the user's request) OR
                |one `read_wiki_page` (concept name from the index below). After that, the
                |other tools are unrestricted.
                |
                |`search_wiki` is for **orientation** — finding the right concept page that
                |names the files and entry points for a subsystem. `search_text` is for
                |**raw strings in code** — CLI flags, error messages, log lines. They are not
                |interchangeable; do the wiki probe regardless of how confident you feel
                |about a `search_text` plan.
                |
                |After the probe:
                |
                |1. **On hit:** read the page; it names the files, classes, and entry points
                |   to open. Use that to navigate instead of broad text search.
                |2. **On miss for a real subsystem** (multiple files, distinct responsibility),
                |   $gapAction Concept pages are ~150–250 lines: purpose, key files with
                |   line refs, control flow, gotchas. Skip page-creation only for one-file or
                |   purely lexical tasks (rename, format, lint).
                |
                |   Use standard Markdown links between wiki pages: from another concept page,
                |   `[Concept](concept.md)`; from the index, `[Concept](concepts/concept.md)`.
                |   Do not create new `[[concept]]` references.
                |3. Mention any wiki gaps you observed in your final reply so the user knows
                |   coverage improved (or where it still doesn't).
                |
                |The only tasks exempt from the probe are pure lexical edits (rename,
                |format, lint) where you already know the exact symbol or string to change.
