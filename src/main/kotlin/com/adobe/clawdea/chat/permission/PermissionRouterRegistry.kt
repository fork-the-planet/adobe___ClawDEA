 * activated panel's dispatcher was visible to the MCP server), so a permission
 * card for a tool call from a backgrounded tab landed in whichever tab was

     * adding a small wait here costs nothing in the happy path and prevents
     * the spurious "No active chat panel claimed this tool call" deny.
