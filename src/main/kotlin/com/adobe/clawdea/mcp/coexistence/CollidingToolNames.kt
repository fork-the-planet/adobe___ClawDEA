/**
 * The exact ClawDEA tool names that must NOT be registered when the JetBrains
 * MCP server is detected as enabled. Each entry has a same-named or near-same
 * counterpart on the JetBrains side and is dropped to avoid CLI ambiguity.
 *
 * Justification per name:
 * - `search_text`     — JB has the same name with the same semantics.
 * - `find_files`      — JB covers via `find_files_by_glob` + `find_files_by_name_keyword`.
 * - `resolve_symbol`  — JB's `get_symbol_info` (Quick-Doc-style) is richer.
 * - `get_diagnostics` — JB's `get_file_problems` + `build_project` cover the surface.
 *
 * Any change to this set must update [CollidingToolNamesTest].
